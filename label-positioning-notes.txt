Label Positioning Package Evaluation
=====================================

1. d3-force-labels (d3-force with forceCollide)
   - Status: Tested
   - Pros: Labels avoid each other well
   - Cons: Latency issue when clicking and dragging event text
   - Notes: Uses continuous force simulation which may be causing the drag lag

2. D3-Labeler (simulated annealing)
   - Status: Tested
   - Pros: No latency issue when dragging (unlike d3-force-labels)
   - Cons: Labels "jump" after scroll completes (due to debounced recalculation)

3. d3-annotation
   - Status: Not tested
   - Description: Full annotation system with built-in connector types
   - URL: https://d3-annotation.susielu.com/

4. Custom implementation (quadtree-based)
   - Status: Not tested
   - Description: Use D3 quadtree for collision detection without force simulation
